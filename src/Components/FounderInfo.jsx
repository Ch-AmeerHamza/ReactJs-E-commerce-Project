          <h3>My Journey</h3>
          <p>
            At just 20 years old, I've embarked on an entrepreneurial journey fueled by passion and a relentless 
            drive to create something meaningful. Zil-E-Noor was born from my desire to blend traditional elegance 
            with contemporary style, offering premium fashion that helps our customers express their unique identity.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Growing up, I was always fascinated by how clothing transforms confidence and perception. This insight, 
            combined with my passion for business, led to the creation of Zil-E-Noor - a brand that celebrates 
            individuality and craftsmanship.

          <h3>The Zil-E-Noor Vision</h3>
          <p>
            I founded Zil-E-Noor with a clear vision: to create more than just a clothing brand. We're building 
            a community that celebrates cultural heritage while embracing modern design. Every piece we create 
            carries our commitment to quality, ethical production, and empowering self-expression.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            At 20, I'm just getting started. My journey as a young entrepreneur has taught me that age is no barrier 
            to creating something remarkable. With Zil-E-Noor, I'm determined to prove that passion, combined with 
            relentless execution, can build something truly special.
